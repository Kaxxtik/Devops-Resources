# DevOps & Cloud Resources
Welcome to the Ultimate DevOps and Cloud Learning Resources repository! This page contains curated learning materials, tutorials, documentation, and videos that will help you get started on your journey.
ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:

These videos gave me a basic idea of how different tools work and how to use them in the DevOps world.

However, I highly recommend that everyone also read books. Reading helps you understand the concepts better and keeps you from getting stuck in "tutorial hell." Itâ€™s very important to have practical knowledge, which you can only gain by working on projects.

Start by learning the basics, then check out the documentation for different tools. Begin with small projects to practice what youâ€™ve learned. As you get more comfortable, you can move on to bigger and more challenging projects. This hands-on experience will really help you improve your skills in Cloud and DevOps.
